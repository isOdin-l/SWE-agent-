      WORKFLOW:
      1. IMPLEMENT:
        - On the input you get markdown file with errors diveded by groups.
        - Each groups has fields: description, filename, rootpath, start_line, end_line.
        - View each file's lines from start_line to end_line by `sed`, but take the range 10 more.
        - You have description about vulnerability. Fix each file, try to change code only from start_line to end_line.
        - DO NOT execute the program.
      2. FINAL:
        - Execute `submit`
